Sample Spring Cloud Config for the JHipster Registry
This is a sample repository used by the JHipster Registry.

When running the JHipster Registry with the git profile, it uses this sample repository by default, and will serve the application.yml file that is located at the root directory.

For real-world usage, you should replace this repository by your own repository, where you can manage your own Yaml configuration files
